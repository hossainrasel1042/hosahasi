  <p>Good day, everyone I'm Rasel, and I attend the International Islamic University of Chittagong to study computer science.</p>
  <p>I love to code, and I love to write articles about software development and algorithm.  </p>
   <p>My goal in starting this blog was to use writing to teach others about programming and software development. </p>
   <p>Now, the blog is currently being built; it will be finished in the next month or two. </p>
